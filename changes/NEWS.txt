Changelog
=========

0.2 (6-15-2012)
---------------

* Implement timelayer.freeze_elapsed constraint, allowing the user to cap the total allowed
  elapsed time of a layer to a given timedelta
* Fix a bug in the guaranteed-sortedness of timelayers, by implementing timespan.__cmp___
* Fix a bug in the collision detection of timelayer.add, by checking collisions against each
  timespan in the existing layer independently, instead of just checking against the layer's
  boundaries
* Exceptions during timelayer.add now provide more information about why the operation failed
